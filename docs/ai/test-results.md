# Progressive Disclosure — Test Results

> Test run for `recipe-agent-realtime-vision` progressive disclosure docs.

## Step 1 — Structural checks

| Check                                                      | Result               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `L0_repo_card.md` ≤ 50 lines                               | Pass (36)            |
| All 8 L1 files present                                     | Pass                 |
| Each L1 has purpose blockquote + Related Deep Dives        | Pass                 |
| L1 line counts in 80–200 target                            | **Below target** (43–85) — see note |
| L2 `_index.md` present                                     | Pass                 |
| Each L2 opens with "When to Read This" callout             | Pass (3/3)           |
| Relative links resolve (`docs/ai/` + AGENTS.md)            | Pass (51/51, 0 broken) |
| AGENTS.md has How to Load / Git Conventions / Doc Commands | Pass                 |

**Note on L1 line counts:** files are table-dense and information-complete but
run 43–85 lines, mostly under the 80–200 soft target. The standard favors tables
over prose and warns against bloat, so they were left concise rather than padded.
`06_interfaces.md` hits 85 (within target). Accepted deviation for the rest;
revisit if a section needs more depth.

## Step 2/3 — Question runs

Questions span the five standard categories. Each answer was checked against the
repo source before being marked Pass. "Level" is the lowest disclosure level
that fully answers the question.

### Setup & Build

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | How do I install and run it locally? | `bun run setup` then `bun run dev` (backend :8000 + web :3000). Allow camera when prompted. | `L1/01_setup.md` ↔ `package.json` scripts | L1 | Pass |
| 2 | Which env vars are required? | `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`. | `L1/01_setup.md`, `06_interfaces.md` ↔ `agent.py`, `.env.example` | L1 | Pass |
| 3 | Is this zero-key? | No — `OPENAI_API_KEY` with Realtime access is required. | `L1/01_setup.md`, `07_gotchas.md` ↔ `README.md`, `agent.py` | L1 | Pass |

### Test & Run

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 4 | How do I run backend tests without cloud creds? | `cd server && pytest tests -v`; `conftest.py` fakes env + SDK session, no cloud needed. | `L1/04_conventions.md`, `01_setup.md` ↔ `tests/conftest.py` | L1 | Pass (ran: 3 passed) |
| 5 | What's the narrowest gate for a web-only change? | `bun run verify:web`. | `L1/05_workflows.md` ↔ `package.json` | L1 | Pass |
| 6 | What does `verify:local:fastapi` do? | Spawns real FastAPI with `FakeAgent` and proxies routes through the rewrite map. | `L1/03_code_map.md`, `05_workflows.md` ↔ `web/scripts/verify-local-fastapi.ts` | L1 | Pass |

### Conventions

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 7 | What response shape do backend routes use? | `{ code, msg, data }`; `data` only when there's a payload. | `L1/04_conventions.md`, `06_interfaces.md` ↔ `server.py` | L1 | Pass |
| 8 | How are errors mapped to HTTP codes? | `ValueError→400`, `RuntimeError→500`, else 500 via `_to_http_error`. | `L1/04_conventions.md` ↔ `server.py` | L1 | Pass |
| 9 | What are the commit/branch conventions? | Conventional commits `type: description`; branches `type/short-description`; no AI tool names. | `AGENTS.md` Git Conventions | L1 | Pass |

### Development

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 10 | How do I add a new browser-facing route? | Add FastAPI handler → add rewrite in `next.config.ts` → add client helper → extend `verify-api-contracts.ts`. | `L1/05_workflows.md` ↔ source | L1 | Pass |
| 11 | Where is the `/api/*` boundary defined and what must I not add? | Rewrites in `web/next.config.ts`; never add `app/api/**/route.ts` for agent/token logic. | `L1/04_conventions.md`, `07_gotchas.md` ↔ `next.config.ts`, `verify-api-contracts.ts` | L1 | Pass |
| 12 | Where does token generation live? | `server/` (`generate_convo_ai_token` in `server.py`); App Certificate stays server-side. | `L1/02_architecture.md`, `08_security.md` ↔ `server.py` | L1 | Pass |

### Deep Dive

| # | Question | Expected answer | Source of truth | Level | Status |
|---|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| 13 | How is `input_modalities=["text","image"]` wired and can it be disabled? | Hardcoded in `Agent.start()` call to `build_realtime_mllm(...)`. To change: edit that call and update `test_realtime_config.py`. | `L2/realtime_vision_mllm_config.md` ↔ `agent.py`, `realtime_config.py` | L2 | Pass |
| 14 | How does the camera get released when the conversation ends or the tab closes? | Two paths: `useEffect` cleanup calls `localCameraTrack?.stop()/close()` on unmount; `handleEndConversation` unpublishes then stops/closes. | `L2/camera_lifecycle.md` ↔ `ConversationComponent.tsx` | L2 | Pass |
| 15 | How does stop survive a backend restart? | `_sessions` is in-memory; missing session falls back to `client.stop_agent(agent_id)`. | `L2/session_lifecycle.md` ↔ `agent.py` | L2 | Pass |

## Step 4 — Analysis

- All 15 questions answered at the expected disclosure level (12 at L1, 3 at L2).
  No "correct but needed L2 unnecessarily" or "wrong/missing L2" cases.
- No missing-coverage findings; no broken references (51/51 links resolve).
- One soft deviation: most L1 line counts below the 80–200 target (accepted; concise/table-dense). `06_interfaces.md` is within target at 85.
- Vision-specific content (always-on `input_modalities`, camera lifecycle, dual release paths) is correctly surfaced at L1 and L2 with no gaps.

## Step 5 — Summary

| Category       | Questions | Pass | Notes |
| -------------- | :-------: | :--: | ----- |
| Setup & Build  | 3 | 3 | — |
| Test & Run     | 3 | 3 | backend tests executed: 3 passed |
| Conventions    | 3 | 3 | — |
| Development    | 3 | 3 | — |
| Deep Dive      | 3 | 3 | resolved at L2 as designed |
| **Total**      | **15** | **15** | — |

## Step 6 — Fixes / Retest

No failing questions; no fixes required. Evidence executed during this run:

- `pytest tests -q` (throwaway venv `/tmp/v_rt_vision`, Python 3.14.4) → `3 passed`.
- Relative link check → `51 checked, 0 broken`.
- Note: sandbox environment; `bun run verify:web` and `bun run verify:local` not executed (no bun/node in this sandbox).
