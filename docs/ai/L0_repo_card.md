# recipe-agent-realtime-vision — Repo Card

> Next.js web client + Python FastAPI backend for an Agora Conversational AI voice agent driven by a single OpenAI Realtime MLLM (voice-to-voice, server_vad) with vision input — the user's camera is published alongside mic so the model can also see.

## L1 — Summaries

The Audience column helps agents prioritise: **Use** = consuming the recipe's behavior, **Maintain** = modifying internals.
